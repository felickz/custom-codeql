# Use this configuration file when looking to get the broadest coverage of security results from the CodeQL Built in packs and the GitHub Security Lab Community packs.
# WARNING: A notable amount of false positives may be found in this configuration.  If you wish to reduce the number of false positives, use the default codeql suites :)
# NOTE: This configuration will not include audit level queries intended for gathering information about the codebase, and debugging queries intended for CodeQL developers.
